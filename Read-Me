This is a simple game that was developed using the unity game engine.

To be able to play this game I created a HTML file that contains a link to the site I was able to post it to.
If you run the file called HomeIndex.html you can click on the link and play the game.

Since the game is really simple their is no menu for it.
To play the game use the arrow key to rotate the ship around the planet to intercept the hazards.
if the ship is not successful the planet gets hit and the game automatically restarts.
